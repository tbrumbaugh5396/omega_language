# business-control — dev conventions

## Ports

- **8860 is the preview server's.** Tenants are addressed by hostname on it
  (`zenjoy.localhost:8860`, `lingua.localhost:8860`), so `autoPort` stays
  false — a moved port breaks every tenant's front door. Never run an
  ad-hoc server on 8860; killing the preview's process to take the port is
  exactly the collision this file exists to prevent.
- **8861 is the scratch port for verification runs.** Anything Claude (or a
  script) starts by hand goes here:

  ```bash
  nohup .venv/bin/python scripts/launch.py --port 8861 > /tmp/bc-verify.log 2>&1 &
  ```

  Host-header routing ignores the port, so every tenant answers the same
  way: `curl -H "host: zenjoy.localhost" http://127.0.0.1:8861/`. Kill it
  when done (`lsof -ti:8861 | xargs kill`). Both servers share `data/` —
  SQLite WAL handles the two dev processes.

- The server binds `127.0.0.1`; curl that address, not `localhost` (IPv6).

## Tests

`PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python tests/test_smoke.py` — script-style, one
file, prints `all N checks passed`. Takes ~3–4 minutes; run in background
with output to a file.

## Backups

`scripts/backup.py` archives the whole fleet (pulls from worker nodes) and
writes `data/backups/last.json`; exit 1 = some tenant missed. Production
cron: `17 2 * * *` on the provider box only — see docs/product/DEPLOY.md.
